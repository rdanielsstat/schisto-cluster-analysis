  abstract  = "Schistosomiasis is among the most common parasitic diseases in
               the world, with over 142 million people infected in low- and
               middle-income countries. Measuring population-level transmission
               is centrally important in guiding schistosomiasis control
               programs. Traditionally, human Schistosoma mansoni infections
               have been detected using stool microscopy, which is logistically
               difficult at program scale and has low sensitivity when people
               have low infection burdens. We compared serological measures of
               transmission based on antibody response to S. mansoni soluble
               egg antigen (SEA) with stool-based measures of infection among
               3,663 preschool-age children in an area endemic for S. mansoni
               in western Kenya. We estimated force of infection among children
               using the seroconversion rate and examined how it varied
               geographically and by age. At the community level, serological
               measures of transmission aligned with stool-based measures of
               infection ($\rho$ = 0.94), and serological measures provided
               more resolution for between-community differences at lower
               levels of infection. Force of infection showed a clear gradient
               of transmission with distance from Lake Victoria, with 94\% of
               infections and 93\% of seropositive children in communities <1.5
               km from the lake. Force of infection increased through age 3 y,
               by which time 65\% (95\% CI: 53\%, 75\%) of children were SEA
               positive in high-transmission communities-2 y before they would
               be reached by school-based deworming programs. Our results show
               that serologic surveillance platforms represent an important
               opportunity to guide and monitor schistosomiasis control
               programs, and that in high-transmission settings preschool-age
               children represent a key population missed by school-based
               deworming programs.",

               absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. Design,
               Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial of
               azithromycin vs matching placebo conducted from May 2020 through
               March 2021. Outpatients from the US were enrolled remotely via
               internet-based surveys and followed up for 21 days. Eligible
               participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result
               (nucleic acid amplification or antigen) within 7 days prior to
               enrollment, were aged 18 years or older, and were not

               screened, 297 were ineligible, 44 refused participation, and 263
               were enrolled. Participants, investigators, and study staff were
               masked to treatment randomization. Interventions: Participants
               were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to a single oral 1.2-g dose of
               azithromycin (n = 171) or matching placebo (n = 92). Main
               Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was absence of
               self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. There were 23
               secondary clinical end points, including all-cause
               hospitalization at day 21. Results: Among 263 participants who
               were randomized (median age, 43 years; 174 [66\%] women; 57\%
               non-Hispanic White and 29\% Latinx/Hispanic), 76\% completed the
               trial. The trial was terminated by the data and safety
               monitoring committee for futility after the interim analysis. At
               day 14, there was no significant difference in proportion of
               participants who were symptom free (azithromycin: 50\%; placebo:
               50\%; prevalence difference, 0\%; 95\% CI, -14\% to 15\%; P >
               .99). Of 23 prespecified secondary clinical end points, 18
               showed no significant difference. By day 21, 5 participants in
               the azithromycin group had been hospitalized compared with 0 in
               the placebo group (prevalence difference, 4\%; 95\% CI, -1\% to
               9\%; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: Among outpatients with
               SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with a single dose of
               azithromycin compared with placebo did not result in greater
               likelihood of being symptom free at day 14. These findings do
               not support the routine use of azithromycin for outpatient
               SARS-CoV-2 infection. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov

               and death in the developing world. Uncertainties about the
               protective effect of Vi polysaccharide vaccine in children under
               the age of 5 years and about the vaccine's effect under
               programmatic conditions have inhibited its use in developing
               countries. METHODS: We conducted a phase 4 effectiveness trial
               in which slum-dwelling residents of Kolkata, India, who were 2
               years of age or older were randomly assigned to receive a single
               dose of either Vi vaccine or inactivated hepatitis A vaccine,
               according to geographic clusters, with 40 clusters in each study
               group. The subjects were then followed for 2 years. RESULTS: A
               total of 37,673 subjects received a dose of a study vaccine. The
               mean rate of vaccine coverage was 61\% for the Vi vaccine
               clusters and 60\% for the hepatitis A vaccine clusters. Typhoid
               fever was diagnosed in 96 subjects in the hepatitis A vaccine
               group, as compared with 34 in the Vi vaccine group, with no
               subject having more than one episode. The level of protective
               effectiveness for the Vi vaccine was 61\% (95\% confidence
               interval [CI], 41 to 75; P<0.001 for the comparison with the
               hepatitis A vaccine group). Children who were vaccinated between
               the ages of 2 and 5 years had a level of protection of 80\%
               (95\% CI, 53 to 91). Among unvaccinated members of the Vi
               vaccine clusters, the level of protection was 44\% (95\% CI, 2
               to 69). The overall level of protection among all residents of
               Vi vaccine clusters was 57\% (95\% CI, 37 to 71). No serious
               adverse events that were attributed to either vaccine were
               observed during the month after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The Vi
               vaccine was effective in young children and protected
               unvaccinated neighbors of Vi vaccinees. The potential for
               combined direct and indirect protection by Vi vaccine should be
               considered in future deliberations about introducing this
               vaccine in areas where typhoid fever is endemic.

               of 3,612 serum samples collected at three time points from
               children 1-5 years of age were tested for antibody responses to
               two schistosome antigens (soluble egg antigen [SEA] and Sm25) by
               multiplex bead assay. The overall prevalence of antibody
               responses to SEA was high at baseline (50.0\%). After one round
               of mass drug administration (MDA), there was minimal change in
               odds of SEA positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02, confidence

               positivity (OR = 0.80, CI = 0.63-1.02, P = 0.08). In contrast to
               the SEA results, prevalence of antibody responses to Sm25 was
               lowest at baseline (14.1\%) and higher in years 2 (19.8\%) and 3

               significant decrease in the proportion of 1-year-olds with
               positive SEA responses from 33.1\% in year 1 to 13.2\% in year 3
